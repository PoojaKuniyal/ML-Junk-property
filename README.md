# Flag the junk property listing.
<p>DESCRIPTION : Classification problem<br>
As the real estate becomes a scarce commodity in big cities of the world; renovating old
properties for sale is becoming a thriving business. However, not every property becomes an
attractive portfolio after tons of time, money and effort goes into giving it a second life. <br>
  Flagging a property as possibly junk before hand can help businesses prioritise their efforts and
focus them on the more probable successes rather than bogged down with the weight of
unsaleable portfolio . This project focuses on building a  predictive model for <b>predicting whether a property should be marked as junk</b> on the basis of listing details and preliminary assessment details.
